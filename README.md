# ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS-FOR-EQUIPMENT-FAILURES-NM

📘 Introduction

Industrial equipment often experiences failures due to various environmental and operational factors such as excessive vibration, high temperatures, or abnormal pressure levels. This project simulates real-time sensor data to mimic such scenarios, forming the foundation for advanced analytics and predictive maintenance systems.


🎯 Objective

Simulate sensor readings for vibration, temperature, and pressure.

Mimic real-time data streaming.

Establish a framework for analyzing abnormal equipment behavior.

Support future development in root cause analysis and predictive failure detection.


📁 Data Source

Simulated Data using Python's random module.

No external hardware or real sensor data is required.

Each sensor reading includes:

Vibration: 0.1 – 1.5 (arbitrary units)

Temperature: 25 – 100 °C

Pressure: 1.0 – 5.0 bar


🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Libraries:

random – Data simulation

time – Real-time streaming simulation

pandas – Placeholder for future data analysis


📊 Potential Visualizations
(You can add these features later using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly.)

Time series plots for each parameter

Heatmaps to detect anomalies

Correlation matrices between parameters

Threshold alerting with color-coding
